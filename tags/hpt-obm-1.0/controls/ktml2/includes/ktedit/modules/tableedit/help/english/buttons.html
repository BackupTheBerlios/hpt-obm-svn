	<div class="title">Table Manipulation</div>
	<div class="content"> 
	  <p>When the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;TD&gt;</font> tag
	    is selected, the Cell Inspector is displayed. Besides cell attributes,
	    this inspector allows you to manage rows, columns and cells, through
	    a special group of buttons: </p>
      <img src="../img/colspan.gif" width="105" height="49" border="1">	
	 
	    <p><strong>Increase Colspan</strong><br>
	    The &#8220;colspan&#8221; attribute can be set to cause a single table cell
	    to span more than one column. In order to perform this action, click on
	    the Increase Colspan button. Each click expands the current cell to one
	    more column.</p>
	    <p><strong>Decrease Colspan</strong><br>
	    If the cell spans only one column, and you click on the Decrease Colspan
	    button, the KTML3 editor will display an error message: &#8220;Cell can't
	    be divided. Add another cell instead&#8221;. Otherwise, the span will be
	    gradually removed each time you click on Decrease Colspan, such that each
	    cell corresponds to a single column.</p>
          <p><strong>Increase Rowspan</strong><br>
            The &#8220;rowspan&#8221; attribute can be set to
            cause a single table cell to span more than one row. In order to
            perform this action, click on the
	    Increase Rowspan button from the Property Inspector. Each click expands
	    the current cell to one more row.</p>
      
	      <p><strong>Decrease Rowspan</strong><br>
	        If the cell spans only one row, and you click on the Decrease Rowspan
	    button, the KTML3 editor will display an error message: &#8220;Row Span
	    is already set to one&#8221;. Otherwise, cells spanning more than one row
	    will be divided, such that each cell corresponds to a single row.</p>
	      <p><strong>Add Column</strong><br>
	    Another important feature of the KTML3 editor is the possibility of adding
	    new columns to tables. You should place the cursor inside a cell and
	    click on the Add Column button. The new column is inserted to the left
	    of the
	    current one.</p>
      
          <p><strong>Remove Column</strong><br>
      You can also delete an existing column from a table. To
        do that, place the cursor inside one of the column's cells and click
        on the Remove Column button. </p>
          <p><strong>Add Row</strong><br>
            The &#8220;Add Row&#8221; feature is very similar to the &#8220;Add Column&#8221; one.
	    You should place the cursor inside a cell and click on the Add Row button.
	    The new row is inserted above the current one.</p>
     
	      <strong>Remove Row</strong><br>
      To remove a row, place the cursor inside one of the row's cells
	      and click on the Remove Row button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
