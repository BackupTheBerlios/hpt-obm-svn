	  The KTML3 Spellchecker user interface will allow you to
	  quickly identify misspelled words, to choose one of the suggested corrections
	  or replace them
	  with new expressions, and to add words to the dictionary. You can also
	  ignore one or all the instances of a word and to change one or all the instances,
	  at once.<br>

	    This text field will display the selected suggestion work. The default
	    value is the first dictionary word that is considered a close match by
	    the spell checker. To change this value, users should navigate through

	    list by using the up and down arrows displayed on the list right border.
	    To make a selection users should click on a word. If users double click

	  <p><strong>Language</strong><br>
	    Users can specifies the language to use by the spell checker.
	        The default language is the KTML3 default language, which was set
	    when the KTML3
	        field was inserted on the page. Users can change the language by
	    making a selection
      in the dropdown menu.</p>
	  <p>When a new language is selected, KTML3 will reload
	      the current page into the spell checker. This operation could take
	    some time depending on the
	      connection speed as the checker has to reload the page content from
	    the server and save it into a temporary array.</p>
	  <p>Once a selection is made, the &quot;Suggestions&quot; field
	    is automatically updated with using a dictionary corresponding to the selected
	    language.
	    Each time the language is changed, the checker will verify all the page.
	    This behavior will not allow users to use a certain language on certain
	    page zone and other language for another page zone.</p>
	  <p><strong>Ignore</strong><br>
	    The &quot;Ignore Once&quot; command will ignore the current unknown word,
	    and continue spell check. If another occurrence of this word will be
    later found in the page, the spell checker will underline it and offer suggestions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
	  <p><strong>Ignore
	      All</strong><br>
        This command will ignore all occurrences of the current unknown word
      in the entire document, and continues with the spell check.</p>
	  <p><strong>Add to Dictionary</strong><br>
        This command will allow users to add into dictionary unknown words
	        that are considered correct by users. This situation is often met in
	        case
	      of names (products, companies, software applications, etc). After the
      word is added, the spell checker will pass to the next unknown word.</p>
	  <p><strong>Change</strong><br>
	    Will replace the unknown word with the suggestion displayed in the &quot;Replace
    With                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &quot; window, and continue spell check.</p>
